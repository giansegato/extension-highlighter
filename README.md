# Highlight Extension

Chrome extension to highlight text on the screen, and copy it to the clipboard.

Hitting `e` while active will highlight the selected text. Hitting `Ctrl + Q` will erase everything from the page. `Ctrl + W` will undo the last selection.

The extension uses local cache to store highlights, and tries to re-highlight the text after reload.
